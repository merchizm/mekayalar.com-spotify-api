# mekayalar.com Spotify Now Playing API

With this API, an end-point is created for **the currently playing** feature on mekayalar.com.

## Usage
Requirements to use this API;

* A Spotify developer application created on the [Spotify Developer Dashboard](https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard/applications).
* We need the access and refresh tokens that you created for your spotify account through the application you created.

### Get Application Client ID and Client Secret

1. Go to the [Spotify Developer Dashboard](https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard/applications).
2. Click on the application you created.
3. Copy the Client ID and Client Secret.
4. Paste them into the `.env.example` file.
5. Rename the `.env.example` file to `.env`.

### Get Access Token & Refresh Token

You can see the details from [here](https://www.postman.com/merichrocks/workspace/aa4aa261-15b8-40b8-8b61-c0ad23137a3f/overview).

After you get the codes, you can place the codes on `cursor.json.example` and rename this file to `cursor.json`.


## That's it! You can now use the API. ðŸŽ‰

** ups, I forgot, you should run the `composer dump-autoload` and `composer install` commands on the project directory.
